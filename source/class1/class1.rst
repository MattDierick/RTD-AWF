Class 1 - Getting started with WAF, Bot Detection and Threat Campaigns
######################################################################


This class will focus on a best practice approach to getting started with F5 WAF and application security. 
This introductory class will give you guidance on deploying WAF services in a successive fashion. 
This 141 class focuses entirely on the negative security model aspects of WAF configuration.
In this class, we will deploy a modern application (Arcadia Finance app) with modern tools in a modern environment.

What is a modern environment:
   - Kubernetes
   - Docker containers with docker registry

.. note:: Don't be afraid if you don't know those tools. The goal of the lab is not to learn how to deploy them, but how to use them.

**First of all, this is Arcadia Finance application**
